This project was very up and down for me. Some parts were really easy because I’ve made a lot of websites before, so I already have a lot of HTML knowledge. It wasn't that hard getting started and most of the code I already knew how to write. However, it was difficult unlearning using CSS, JavaScript, and modern HTML features that I'm normally used to using in my own projects. The main challenge of this project was getting it done on time. I got the code done in no time at all, but I battled every issue with Github Classroom (this would not be the first time for me, unfortunately). I had to turn this in late because I couldn't even get it working on my home desktop until maybe 20 minutes ago. Normally, I would have completed it on my laptop where it has no issues, but I didn't have access to it for the past few days. I should have started earlier and prepared for that, so that is on me. Otherwise, I really liked doing this project.
